# BeerpongLeaderboard
The ultimate leader of leaders and boards.


Bug when registering with thrid party credentials. Dosn't take you to intro, but to home.
First time login with thrid party credentials does not update username properly locally resulting in non existing documents being loaded from the server. (Also happens for new logins. should probably reconsider login process.)
